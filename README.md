# MemoGame: Concentration (Memory Game)
ðŸŽ® Whatâ€™s This Game About?
MemoGame is a modern take on the classic memory card-matching gameâ€”also known as Concentration. The idea is simple but addictive: flip over cards, remember where everything is, and find all the matching pairs before time runs out or your guess limit hits zero.

Itâ€™s a fun mental workout with a clean design and a bit of pressure (in a good way). I picked this game because itâ€™s something weâ€™ve all played in some form growing up, and I wanted to give it a digital twist thatâ€™s both simple to play and satisfying to win.

ðŸš€ How to Play / How it works:

Youâ€™ll see a grid of cardsâ€”all face-down.
Click two cards to flip them over and try to find a match.
If they match, great! Theyâ€™ll stay face-up. If not, theyâ€™ll flip back after a second.
You win if you match all the pairs before time runs out or before hitting the guess limit.
If the timer hits zero or your wrong guesses run outâ€”you lose.
Use the Restart button to try again, or hit Exit to go back to the welcome screen.
